<h2>Additional Instructions</h2>

<h3>Setting up your Portfolio</h3>

<p>One of the best things about this theme is its ability to hold a nice portfolio section. Most of this is handled automatically, though there are a few things to know.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a category called 'Portfolio' (this is the most crucial step, the theme will automatically detect this category and pull the first image from every post within this category in the homepage slider.</li>
	<li>Make a new post for each item in your Portfolio.</li>
	<li>For each post, you should use the WYSIWYG editor to upload and insert the image you want to display in the homepage slider. You can add text and other images within the post, but the homepage slider will ONLY SHOW the first image inserted in each post.
	
	<small>IMPORTANT: The size of the image should ALWAYS be 580x350 for each item. You can leave white space inside this area but for the image slider to function properly the images must be the correct size.</small></li>

	<li>Enjoy your awesome and easy-to-use Portfolio section.</li>

<h3>Setting Your Theme's Options</h3>

<p>There are various options for your theme, such as changing the colors and setting text values for different customizable areas. To access this theme's options page, in your WordPress admin go to "DesignFolio+" and your options will be displayed in a tabbed layout.</p>

<p>To set up Flickr, you need to enter your user ID, NOT YOUR FLICKR ACCOUNT USERNAME. This can be found in the URL string of your Flickr account's photostream:</p>

<code>http://www.flickr.com/photos/<strong>16523028@N03</strong>/</code>

<p>The numbers and letters between the slashes (16523028@N03) are your Flickr ID.</p>
